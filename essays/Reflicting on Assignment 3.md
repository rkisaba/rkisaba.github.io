<h2>Briefly describe your system</h2>
<p>My system is a clothing store that sells items such as shirts and pants, but also accessories like rings, earrings, and bracelets, in addition to a variety of shoes. In this sense, I suppose my store a little more similar to a department store.</p>
<h2>Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?</h2>

<p>One thing that I wasn’t able to finish, but really wanted to do was to allow the user to come back to the same page that they were on in the same session. So, as long as they were still within the session, it would take them back to the page they were last viewing.</p>
<h2>Describe what you are most proud of about your system:</h2>
<p>In this system, I am most proud of the fact that I was able to simplify my code in order to make things easier for me to navigate. I actually rebuilt my store, in order for it to fit the requirements of Assignment 3 easier.</p>

<h2>Describe what you are least happy with your system:</h2>
<p>I am least happy with the aesthetics of my system. I think the pages are not the most aesthetically pleasing, to the point where it actually may affect the ease-of-use for the customer. If I could go back and do this again, I would probably re-organize my pages. For example, I just organized everything vertically, which makes it really long to scroll through a whole page. I would instead create more columns of products, and create a horizontal navigation bar at the top <i>and</i> bottom of the page, instead of a sidebar dropdown that I used from W3 schools.</p>

<h2>How was developing this assignment different than assignment #2?</h2>
<p>Developing Assignment 3 was in some ways very different, but also very similar. For example, since I re-did my webpage, I had to go back and do things that I had done for Assignments 1 and 2. The main difference that I saw when it came to designing the features for Assignment 3 was that the amount of actual writing I did was significantly less in proportion to the amount of planning that I did. In Assignment 3, it required my attention to map out how everything would cohesively interact. In Assignment 2, I designed everything to kind of chain together, but since I had multiple pages I couldn’t necessarily do that. I wouldn’t be smart to force customers to have to go through every product page in order to checkout, so I couldn’t just carry the info the same in between pages as I did in Assignment 2. </p>

<h2>When you ran into a problem, what did you do to address it?</h2>
<p>When I ran into a problem, I would first check for any syntax errors. After that, I would go line by line and inspect each line of code. In many cases that was enough to find my misspelled variable or something stupid like that. However, if that was not enough, I would try to re-write it by commenting first and then writing the actual code.</p>

<h2>Describe what worked well in doing this assignment?</h2>
<p>What worked extremely well was rewriting my code from Assignments 1 and 2. In those assignments, I was stubborn and didn’t listen to the advice to look ahead at this assignment. By rewriting my code with this assignment in mind, I was able to be more efficient in my code. I eliminated a lot of redundancy and was able to actually decrease the amount of code I had in the first place, but only by a very small margin.</p>

<h2>Describe what did not work well in doing this assignment?</h2>
<p>I had a really hard time fixing the simple mistakes that I made. I don’t know if it was the exhaustion from studying for finals or my just getting complacent, but I found I made a lot of stupid simple mistakes. This increased my debugging time significantly because I would always think that it was some complex mistake and not realize that I didn’t define a variable, misspelled something within my code, or was just being unorganized which lead to an error.</p>

<h2>What did you learn from doing this assignment?</h2>
<p>From this assignment I learned that the amount of planning you do before goes hand-in-hand with how long you will code for. The more planning you do ahead of time, the less time you will spend actually coding. If you spend little to no time planning, you will pay for it tenfold when you start coding.</p>

<h2>If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?</h2>
<p>If could go back and do this again, I would probably do more visual planning. Actually drawing out and mapping the path of my code. When planning, I would write things out, like this page will connect to this page. Instead, I should have actually drew out my pages and noted where each button will link to and how it will link.</p>

<h2>Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging</h2>
<p>40% planning, 25% writing code, 35% testing and debugging</p>

<h2>Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself) and explain briefly your rationale for the percentage breakdown. Be sure to include an overview of what specifically you and your partners contributed (e.g. “I worked on the security and my partner 1 worked on personalization”)</h2>
<p>I worked on this assignment alone</p>
