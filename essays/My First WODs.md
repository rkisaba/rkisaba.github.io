After completing my first set of WODs I realize how important it is to understand the content. BrowserHistory1 threw me for a bit of a loop and it took me a couple of tries to get. I credit my difficulties to the fact that it was my first WOD and there were bound to be some complications during the setup. I ended up doing my WOD 4 times. The first WOD was by far the worst, coming in at 27 minutes, then incrementally getting shorter until I finished my last one in about 16 minutes. I think the biggest difficulty that I had was trying to narrate what I was doing. I felt like I was fighting my own thoughts and wouldn't make the DNF time.
BrowserHistory2 was a lot easier. Once I found a groove I started to pick up the pace. Even though I did this WOD multiple times, it was just a part of the process that I developed to help me retain what I learn. I do the WOD an initial time to "struggle" through whatever I may need to. Whether it is recording issues or running into problems with my code, I do not worry about the time. Then I start going for the Rx time.
Finally, I hit my stride in BrowserHistory3. The reason that I took 4 times was because I tried to completely trouble-shoot on my own. Typically if I get completely stuck, I refer to the demonstration or Google. However, I felt confident enough in myself by the third WOD, so I tried to do it 100% on my own. This was tough, but I think that I became better for it.
In the future, I think that I am going to stick to my plan of doing an initial run through and then worrying about the time for the following attempts. Once change that I'd make is to finish the attempt that I started even if I'm past the time. I found myself stopping only to get stuck in the same place a restart again on the next attempt.
