<h2>E3 - Performing WODs</h2>
This WOD, <a href = "https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/060.expressions-operators/experience-invoice1.html">invoice1</a>, had us create an invoice to track the costs of certain items. We used java script to create a dynamic webpage containing a table that displayed our product data. The only difficulty that I ran into was that my hardware restricted me. I use a 60% keyboard, so there is no back tick key and I kept getting stuck when I needed to input the javascript in the table. The other reasons for my retries, were other hardware/user errors like forgetting to press record. I feel that I'm starting to get the hang of WODs. Doing them without a timer first really helps me grasp the concept, since I'm not focused on making any time restraint and can evaluate what I'm doing. This kind of follows suit with my other WODs. I first try it without a timer and then start trying to make the Rx time. For this one, I could've tried multiple ways of doing the WOD before timing myself, so that I would've been able to shift when I deviate from what I originally practice. For example, I did the alternative cell method for creating the table during practice, but in the WODs tried to use the document.write, which caused me to run into the hardware roadblock.
