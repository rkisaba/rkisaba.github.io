<h2>E5 - Assignment 2 Reflection</h2>

<h3>Assignment 2 Overview</h3>
<p>In <a href = "https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/150.Assignment2/experience-Assignment2_retrospective.html">assignment 2</a>, we were tasked with creating a login page for our stores. Our login had to allow users to create a new account or edit an existing one. The process that a customer would follow was index, to product page, to login, to invoice.</p>

<h3>What did I learn from this assignment?</h3>
<p>From this assignment, I learned that I need to thoroughly plan out how I will do things. The thing that I have been having a hard time with lately is creating code without a clear picture of what I want. I feel that if I spent just a little more time planning, I would spend a significantly less amount of time writing code.</p>

<h3>How much time did I spend on this assignment?</h3>
<p>I worked alone on this assignment. I felt that it was easier to organize my ideas alone rather than collaborating with a partner.</p>

<h3>How did I get help></h3>
<p>This assignment, I regretably did not ask for help. However, looking back it would've saved me a lot of grief and time if I had just swallowed my pride and spoke up.</p>

<h3>How was developing this assignment different from Assignment 1?</h3>
<p>This assignment was different in the way that assignment was a lot of creation in terms of actually constructing the store. This included the page designs and making sure that customers had a good experience. However, for Assignment 2, it was a little more technical in that it wasn't so focused on the client side of the store, but rather focused on the back end. Things like maintaining data between pages is one of the challenges we had to face.</p>

<h3>Estimate the amount of time you spent on this assignment</h3>
<p>On Assignment 2, I spent <b>15%</b> thinking about how I was going to do things, <b>40%</b> writing code, and <b>45%</b> testing and debugging.</p>

<h3>What worked well and what didn't?</h3>
<p>For the most part, the things that I planned for and coded eventually did work. Writing a bit of code at a time worked well for me and I plan to maintain that strategy moving forward. However, what didn't work well was my poor planning beforehand. I didn't thoroughly plan out how I was going to do things, so when something didn't work, I ended up adding unnecessary code that ended up making things very complicated.</p>

<h3>What would I do differently?</h3>
<p>If I could go back and do this assignment all over again, I would plan my time a little better. It would've helped to createa project board and a roadmap to plan out the weeks leading up to the due date. I think for Assignment 3, I am going to try to create a stricter schedule and use a project board/roadmap to ensure that things are moving along at a good pace. Another thing that I would do differently is schedule more office hours or review the examples more in-depth.</p>
