<h2>Early Life</h2>
Growing up everyone has dreams. To become an astronaut, fire fighter, or a pro athlete. While those all sounded like excellent careers, none really pulled me in. I would answer the age old question "What do you wannt to be when you grow up?" with a simple shrug. However, I realized that that couldn't be my answer forever. So, I started to do some digging.
<h2>High school</h2>
Once I started seriously thinking about what I wanted to do, my counselor had me take a skills/personality test. It gave me a baseline for careers that I matched. My largest personality trait came back as "problem solver". Unfortunately, solving jigsaw puzzles isn't a career choice, so I had to do a little more searching. That was until a particular class project. In my senior year in high school, we were tasked with researching a business, my friends and I said "the best way to learn is to actually do it", so we went and started our own business. This was the first time in my life that I really felt challenged. Thus I knew that I wanted to be a business major.
<h2>Starting College</h2>
So how do you go from starting your own business in high school to becoming an MIS major? Doesn't entrepreneurship make more sense? Well you would be correct, but there was one more thing that I left out. . . My interest in technology started the summer before I entered college. I had built my first computer and have been hooked on everything technology (hardware, sotftware, programming, etc.) ever since. MIS provided an interesting opportunity to combine Business, my original academic plan, whith tech, my new found interest.
