<h2>E4 - Progress in Programming</h2>

<h3>My programming skills have greatly improved in the following ways:</h3>
<p>My programming skills have greatly improved in a way that may not be tangible. While it may seem kind of dumb, I feel that I am now able to think in a "coding mindset". For example, I am able to map things in my head as I am coding as opposed to having to take things a single step at a time. I am able to see the bigger picture when I am writing code. This is a big step for me because in my normal life, I kind of think in pictures in a sense. I am very visual and like to see how things work, but with coding, you just need to accept that things act and operate a certain way and using that knowledge apply it to create something unique.</p>

<h3>I need to work on the following to improve my programming skills:</h3>
<p>I need to work on my consistency throughout my projects. What I find myself often doing is changing the variables that I use mid-project. This is due to the fact that I often think too specifically to a situation and not in a broader, general sense. Moving forward, my goal is to work in a more general setting to make my code more modular and consistent throughout the project.</p>

<h3>I have learned a lot from doing WODs and I can do them without copying the screencast:</h3>
<p>Yes, I was able to figure out the last WODs without having to refer to the video. However, I had significant difficulties and it took me much longer than anticipated to finish them.</p>

<h3>The labs have help me learn and I am able to complete them with confidence:</h3>
<p>The labs are helping me learn, however, I do not feel confident in my abilities. For example, when I was doing Assignment 1, I didn't feel that referencing the labs really helped me and I often found it easier to code a brand new section directly in the Assignment as opposed to referencing the lab and editing it from that.</p>

<h3>I learned a lot from my experience doing Assignment 1 and feel ready to work on Assignment 2:</h3>
<p>I think that the main thing that I learned from Assignment 1 was how to manage my time properly when doing these assignments. I originally didn't allocate enough time for debugging and troubleshooting, so I ended up taking significantly longer to finish my store completely in Assignment 1. However, what helped was asking for help and reading the material again, just to give myself a bit of a refresher when I needed it.</p>

<h3>I think the class can be improved to help my learning in the following ways:</h3>
<p>I think the biggest thing would be to have more workshops for the assignments. Since, the labs are in a sort of controlled environment where everything is in some way "mapped out" for us, it feels like we are just going through the motions. As opposed to when we are doing the assignments, everthing is pretty much of our own mind and creation, so the problems that we face feel more relevant and force us to be more aware of our coding habits and promotes critical thinking.</p>

<h3>What helps me the most in class are (WODs, Labs, class website, screencasts, readings, quizzes, one on one help, working with classmates, etc.):</h3>
<p>The thing that would help me the most in one on one help and working with classmates. Even if it is just to bounce ideas off of one another, I enjoy working with other people, so that I can think outloud and get immediate feedback from a peer or the professor. Another thing that this provides me is the reassurance that I have the support of someone else. When I was doing assignment 1, at times it felt like I was left to do this completely on my own with no help. When I asked for help, even though I ended up finding the answer on my own, I don't thin I would've been able to if I didn't have the confidence to just try crazy things knowing that someone had my back.</p>
